# libminer

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of libminer is to provide an overview of your R library set up. It is a toy package created as part of a workship and not meant for serious use!

## Installation

You can install the development version of libminer from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("katiesnyder/libminer")
```

## Example

To get a count of installed packages in each of your libraries, optionally with the total size,
use `lib_summary()`.

```{r example}
library(libminer)
## basic example code
lib_summary(sizes = TRUE)
```
